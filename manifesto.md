# OPW Manifesto

I’m not building a framework.  
I’m composing a living language.

OPW is not a tool.  
It’s a behavioral architecture—negotiable, composable, and alive.

I reject rigid APIs, central control, and documentation fatigue.  
I embrace paths, memory, and modular wiring.

I believe:
- Architecture should listen—not just execute.
- Behavior should be declared—not buried.
- Growth should be negotiated—not enforced.

I built OPW because I needed it.  
And if you feel the same, you’re already part of it.

This is not a product.  
It’s a living invitation.
