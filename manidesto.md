# OPW Manifesto

We are not building a framework.  
We are composing a living language.

OPW is not a tool.  
It’s a behavioral architecture—negotiable, composable, and alive.

We reject rigid APIs, central control, and documentation fatigue.  
We embrace paths, memory, and modular wiring.

In OPW:
- Functions don’t declare themselves—they are declared by behavior.
- Companies don’t dominate—they contribute.
- Developers don’t obey—they compose.

We believe:
- Architecture should listen—not just execute.
- Behavior should be declared—not buried.
- Growth should be negotiated—not enforced.

OPW is a language for those who want to speak in behavior.  
Not just code. Not just structure. But living intent.

Join us.
